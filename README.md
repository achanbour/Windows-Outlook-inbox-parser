This Python script automates the process of monitoring incoming emails in the Outlook mailbox to identify those that contain specific keywords in their subject lines. The script uses the Python ```pywin32``` package which allows it to access the email server via the local Outlook app. For this reason, the Outlook app must be installed on the local machine to be able to run this script. This parser scans incoming emails and filters them out based on predefined keywords in the subject. Once a matching email is found, the script archives the found email in a defined folder then sends an alert to a defined list of recipients. This tool is useful for automating email workflows, monitoring for important messages, and reducing manual email management.
